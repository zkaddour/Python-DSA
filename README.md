# Python-DSA
A basic project with the objective of learning the process of creation and optimization of data structures and algorithms in Python, feel free to give me feedback to help me improve in the future. I will use Python version `3.10` throughout this project to keep this consistent and will upgrade it in the future based on the need.

This shouldn't be taken as a tutorial, but rather a reference in the future for Python and the implementation of different algorithms in the language.

## Chapter 1: Basic Language

This folder will contain functions and classes that are native to the Python language and do not require any modules to function:
- **maths.py** : This file contains mathematical classes and functions. Some of them are as basic as adding two numbers together, while others will handle vectors or complex numbers.
- **strings.py** : This file contains string related methods.
