# Python-DSA

A basic project with the objective of learning the process of creation and optimization of data structures and algorithms in Python, feel free to give me feedback to help me improve in the future. I will use Python version `3.10` throughout this project to keep this consistent and will upgrade it in the future based on the need.

This shouldn't be taken as a tutorial, but rather a reference in the future for Python and the implementation of different algorithms in the language.

## Chapter 1: Basic Language

This folder will contain functions and classes that are native to the Python language and do not require any modules to function:

- **lexical.md** : This file dicusses the core language from a lexical viewpoint. This includes: line structure, identifiers, operators and delimiters.

## Ressources

I will use a multitude of ressources while I work on this repo, I wish to give them all credits but I apologize if I miss any:

- [The Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html)
- [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
