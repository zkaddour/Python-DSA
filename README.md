# Python-DSA

A basic project with the objective of learning the process of creation and optimization of data structures and algorithms in Python, feel free to give me feedback to help me improve in the future. I will use Python version `3.10` throughout this project to keep this consistent and will upgrade it in the future based on the need.

This shouldn't be taken as a tutorial, but rather a reference in the future for Python and the implementation of different algorithms in the language.

## Chapter 1: Basic Language

This chapter will discuss the basics of Python such as math operations, data types, control flow and much more.

- **dataTypes** : A data type is a category for values and every value belongs to exactly one data type. The most common data types in python are integers (int) which represent whole numbers. Numbers with a decimal point are called floating-point numbers (float). Text values are called strings (str), they are always surrounded in single quote (') characters to identify where the string begins and ends. A boolean (bool) is a binary value that can either be True or False, and is usually used to evaluate the truthfulness of statments.

- **mathOperators** : The order of operation (also called predence) of Python math operators is similar to that of mathematics: The exponent operator is evaluated first; the multiplication, division, floor division and modulus operators are evaluated next, from left to right; and the addition and substraction operators are evaluated last (also from left to right). Parantheses can be used to override the usual predecence if needed.

- **stringFunctions** : The meaning of an operator may change based on the data types of the values next to it. For example, `+` is the addition operation on two integers or floats. However, when `+` is used on two string values, it joins them as the string concatentation operator. Attempting to concatenate a string with an int or float number will result in an error as Python expects the user to explicitly convert the integer to a string because Python cannot do this automatically.

## Ressources

I will use a multitude of ressources while I work on this repo, I wish to give them all credits but I apologize if I miss any:
